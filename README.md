## java-stack-list

Lesson about the Stack data structure based on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

Methods used:

#push():

The push() method pushes an element, that is passed as the parameter, on the top of the stack.

#pop():

The pop() method removes and returns the top element of the stack.

An EmptyStackException exception is thrown if we call the pop() method on an empty stack.

#peek():

The peek() method returns the element on the top of the stack but does not remove it.

#empty():

The empty() method returns true if the stack is empty, otherwise, it returns false.
